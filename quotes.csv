"Aggressive or rejected people tend to interpret social situations differently compared to other people.For example, children exposed to peer teasing at school or child abuse at home are much more likely to develop high levels of hostile attribution bias (or interpretation/perception bias): the tendency to interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when ambiguous or benign). This then leads them to behave aggressively at school and at home.Hostile attribution bias is especially linked to ""reactive aggression"" (i.e., impulsive and ""hot-blooded"" aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation)The interpretation bias refers to a person's tendency to unconsciously interpret situations and events in a negative or critical light, even when the situation is not inherently negative. This type of bias can contribute to feelings of insecurity, self-doubt, and low self-esteem, and can be a factor in the development and maintenance of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression.It is a bias of social information processing (similar to fundamental attribution error) and related to Neuroticism, i.e., to being more sensitive to perceived criticism and more likely to interpret ambiguous statements as negative. This tendency is more prevalent in people high in anxiety, insecurity, and self-doubt.Rejection breeds hostile interpretations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Diese großen schaffenden Menschen - der Theorie oder der Praxis - greifen mit mächtiger Hand in das Rad des Daseins; sie drehen seine Speichen ein Stück vorwärts, indem sie das Gefühl in sich tragen, der Welt neue Kräfte gewinnen zu müssen, nicht anders zu können, als Welt zu gestalten, indem sie sich selbst gestalten. Sie fragen nicht nach dem Werte des Lebens, sie fühlen die furchtbaren Gründe, auf denen es ruht, sie kennen seine Furchtbarkeit und seine Untiefen - und gewinnen daraus Einsicht und Kraft, es neu zu gestalten, ihren Willen zur Macht daran zu erproben, selbst wie göttliche Kräfte, darin zu zerstören, zu vernichten, Altes zu zerbrechen, Verbrecher am Gesetz zu werden, um Neues, Größeres werden zu lassen. Sie sagen „Ja"" zum Gesamtdasein und können darum zu keinem Teil„Nein"" sagen: denn die Notwendigkeit verschlingt alle Dinge untrennbar ineinander, daß man alles Sein bejahen muß, wenn man den kleinsten Teil bejaht. Ihre unendlich strömende Kraft freut sich des Gestaltens an dieser Welt, der einzigen Aufgabe des Menschen, seines Künstlerberufs. Sie kennen keine seiende Welt, nur eine werdende, eine sein sollende, an der Menschen ihr und der Welt Geschick zimmern. An den Widerständen, die sie ihnen bietet, wächst ihre Kraft; ihr Wille zur Macht kann sich nie genug tun, dieser Welt immer neue Gestalten zu geben, von ihrer Fülle, dem Reichtum ihrer Geistes- und Willenskräfte in die Welt hinüberströmen zu lassen. Sie sehen auf diese Welt als ihr Werk und wünschen sich nur eins: stets wieder an ihr zu formen bis in alle Unendlichkeit, immer von neuem wieder, unendlich oft. Sie bejahen dieses Dasein und wünschen, so wie es ist, wie es durch sie und ihren Machtwillen wird, möchte es wiederkehren: in gleicher Form unendlich oft in ewiger Wiederkehr. Diese Sehnsucht, ihrem Machtwillen entstammend, gibt ihnen Kraft - und di neue Kraft gibt ihnen neue Sehnsucht.

We've also heard it called ""Pokémon poly,"" after the idea that you need to collect a complete set of different kinds of partners.When we begin to look at people in terms of what needs they can meet rather than as whole people in their own right, we start down the road toward treating people as things.

Contingent self-esteem isfickle, going up and down with a person’s ability to produce results.Acquired self-esteem is a false imitation of true selfesteem: however good it makes one feel in the moment, it does not esteem the self. It esteems only the achievement, without which the self in its own right would be rejected. True self-esteem is who one is; contingent self-esteem is only what one does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The application office was very small, with room for perhaps five people to sit inside. On most days I would see at least twenty people outside, waiting in line to get in. Just outside the building was a wall about three feet high. The people in line often sat on the wall. It's easy to understand why. They might have more than an hour's wait in the hot Florida sun. Whoever managed the passport office was offended by people sitting on the wall. I would see sheets of paper that read ""Do not sit on the wall"" taped to the wall. The signs were routinely ignored. The workers in the passport office didn't want people sitting on the wall, but they didn't hink about why people sat on the wall. When you're waiting in a hot concrete courtyard for an hour, you're going to get tired and want to sit down. The rule was guaranteed to fail. A more effective way to prevent people from sitting on the wall, if that was really a problem. would have been to address the need rather than the action-say by installing benches.The memory of that office and its courtyard has stuck with me. In my own relationships, when I see people doing things I'd rather they didn't do, I try to find out why they're doing it and what might help take care of the need. I try to put benches in the courtyard, rather than putting up signs telling them not to sit on the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, they either get angry or withdraw or tell themselves they can handle it and it isn’t even that big of a deal.Normative male alexithymia refers to the fact that traditional masculine role socialization channels many men into ways of being such that their masculine identity conflicts with many emotions they feel and what they feel they are “allowed” to express (i.e., they will be shamed and will feel as if they are ""not real men"" if they express feelings of vulnerability, dependency needs, weakness, etc.).From: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201411/why-is-it-so-hard-some-men-share-their-feelings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Imagine a young woman standing near a forest on a plain of green grass. She's busy using a shovel to dig into the ground and throw the earth next to her on the grass. Next to her there is standing a grim man who is busy loading the earth on his barrow and transporting it away. The work the woman is doing is strenuous and she hasn't had a whole lot of breaks. As a matter of fact, she hasn't had any real break from it during the last two year. On a daily basis she has just enough breaks to replenish her energy, eat a bit and sleep. The woman, although she knows that she has been doing this since she can think, never got to know why she is doing what she is doing. The only thing she does know is that whenever she stops to think and question what is going on, the grim man besides her starts to shout and get out his whip. The woman learns quickly that she can please the man and consequently be spared the pain if she just keeps on going and whenever she is able to work faster and dig out more mud for the man, he will have mercy and throw a piece of bread in front of her on the ground. After some time, the woman has dug quite a big hole in the ground, 2 meters deep and 2 meters in length and width. At one point she dares to look up from her work and opens her eyes to what is going on around her. She suddenly realizes that there are more women, all engaged in the same work and similarly frightened to ever stop and think, to say nothing of asking the grim man why he is forcing them to dig and dig. Actually, they all seem quite happy at the same time because they have amassed a small portion of breads on the ground. No one ever understood how they came to this place and why they do what they do. No one wondered how the others might have got here or where the grim man comes from. Everyone just knows that you have to keep on working to be spared the intolerable pain and to be more efficient to possibly get a treat of bread. It's beyond the women's imagination to ask what they are digging for, where the mud is going to and what its used for. They don't talk to each other nor do they empathize with each other by giving a little smile to the other women. They know this is not tolerated by the grim man. When one woman did finally dare to give a comforting smile to the very young and desperate woman next to her, the grim man got incredibly angry. From that point in time he took it as his mission to never let them smile again. He told each and every woman that from now on the breaks would be less and the portions to eat even more sparse. However, he told them that each day he would hand out two breads to the two most hard-working women. No more smile from this point in time. No",more empathy. Only ever more narrow-minded working to dig deeper,and,"faster.One tragic day, the women suddenly see what they were digging for. Not that they knew what the mud was for - it had always been transported away. But when one of the women was to weak",to,"continue to work, the grim man took a gun from beneath his coat, shot the woman and pushed her into the hole she had",dug. Graves. These were their graves. But not a moment,"passed until the grim man angrily shouted at the other women to immediately continue to work and speed up. The women, dazzled by what just happened, rushed back to their work station and continued. No one thought about what happened. No one even had a glimpse of a moment to consider what this could mean for themselves. No one dared to think that they might suffer from the same consequence. At least, they comforted themselves in their minds, it wouldn't hit them as long as they continued to please the old man.No one ever asked how they came to this place. No one ever wondered why they lived the way they do. No thought on where the grim man came from. No swift consideration of how the future might look like for them. As a matter of fact, no",thinking about the future at all. No wondering,"of why the man had the gun and the women only the barrows. No one wondered how the others might feel like. On the contrary, each woman wished that the others might feel badly so that the she could get the special portion of bread this day. No one dared to pose a question to the grim man. No one even had the time to think or feel sad because the longer a woman paused the faster the grim man came running to her work station, already pulling his gun. No one",,,,,

"What goals do is they focus us. They focus us on where we want to go. Being focused on a task produces organization and efficiency, both within the organism and in the environment.

Either by breaking it, by climbing it or by asking for help. But once you threw it over the wall, you're much more likely to get over it. When we make the commitment, we are much more liekely to do it. Why? Because the mind doesn't like when there's inconsistency between what is outside in the real world and what is inside our minds. Our words create worlds. What we say we'll do, what we commit to very often creates the reality. Remember: countries were declared into existence by words",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These indicate the strength of the association between that data element and a particular cluster. The degree of belonging, is related inversely to the distance from x to the cluster center. This algorithm (i.e. method) minimizes intra-cluster variance.Clustering is the process of dividing data elements into classes or clusters so that items in the same class are as similar as possible, and items in different classes are as dissimilar as possible. Depending on the nature of the data and the purpose for which clustering is being used, different measures of similarity may be used to place items into classes, where the similarity measure controls how the clusters are formed. Some examples of measures that can be used as in clustering include distance, connectivity, and intensity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mind is never at rest. It is constantly seeking order and significance, testing the world for breaks in the habitual pattern.Artworks rely on this dynamic, unifying quality of the human mind. They provide organized occasions in which we exercise and develop our ability to pay attention, to anticipate upcoming events, to draw conclusions, and to construct a whole out of parts. Every novel leaves something to the imagination; every song asks us to expect a certain melody; every film coaxes us to connect sequences into a larger whole",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1) Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk Risk is involved in every great opportunity in life. If it isn’t risky, then everyone would be doing, thus making it ordinary and not “great.” Separate yourself from the crowd as one who not only can take risks, but enjoys doing so. Certainty in life can only be so comforting until it gets boring. 2) When you lose, don’t lose the lesson If you lose what you have learned not to do, you will be doomed to repeat it. More importantly, however, do fear failure. Failure is the precursor to success. Hardly any great thing that you wish to accomplish will come without failure. This ties back to the rule of risk mentioned above. 3) Follow the three Rs :Respect for self: Confidence is key in success and one who does you respect himself does not believe in himself. Thus, if you do not respect yourself, you cannot possibly succeed in anything great, nor can you respect others. Respect for others: And you will be respected in return. Responsibility for all your actions: You alone are responsible for your feelings, actions, success, etc. You are in complete control of your life, so do not try and blame other people for your mistakes or misfortunes. 4) Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck Not everything that you desire will be necessarily good for you in the long run. If something just seems to not work out continually, in such a way that it seems almost like fate intervened, consider letting it go or coming back to it at another time. The Universe works in mysterious ways and should be trusted. Just be sure you are not mistaking your own failure as the Universe telling you something. 5) Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly Rules are meant to be broken. Most of them are put in place by archaic, corrupt institutions that seek only to enslave and maintain their own power. When it comes to breaking them, be sure to do it properly to avoid punishment. But above all things, make sure you DO in fact break rules. If authority was never questioned, we could be a stagnant civilization. 6) Don’t let a little dispute injure a great friendship Obviously friendship is more important that one small fight, but very few people actually put this rule into practice. They also need to be able to follow rule 7) in order to truly follow what 6) teaches you. 7) When you realize you’ve made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it And do not let your pride get in the way of taking those steps. Apologize, taking full responsibility. That will speak for your character more strongly than the action of making the mistake in the first place. 8) Spend some time","alone every day. No matter what you do, take at least 30 minutes",out,"of your day to spend alone in a quiet place. This will give you at least a half-hour to examine what is going on in your life, to examine yourself and to figure out what you want. Whether it",be,"through prayer, meditation, yoga or golf, this ritual is a must. The Law of Attraction is the best way to spend this","time. 9) Open your arms to change, but don’t let go of","your values This world is constantly changing. If you are not open to change, then you are going to live a very miserable life. You, yourself, are going to change as well, but that does not mean that your values have to change as well. Welcome new places, new faces and new loves, but never change those core parts of you unless you have strong reasons to believe you were wrong to believe them in the first place. 10) Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer Silence leads to relaxed contemplation during which emotions have less influence and logic can take over. For example, in an argument with a friend, remaining silent instead of retaliating with something anger-driven is more efficient in ending the argument faster and with less","hurt for both parties. Or consider Gandhi, who","took down the British Empire through silent, pacifistic behavior. Silence is a powerful tool that few choose to use over irrational action. Consider it next time you find yourself in a difficult situation. 11) Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back, you’ll be able to enjoy it a second time You are going to have to live with your actions for the rest of your life, so save yourself the regret and anguish and live with honor now. Good things also come to good people. You will",never,"be punished for acting with integrity, only rewarded. 12) A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation",for your life This is the rule that you have the least amount of,control over. Your family,dynamic will ultimately determine...

"Erkenntnisse zur 'Selbstliebe': Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich verstanden, dass ich immer und bei jeder Gelegenheit zur richtigen Zeit am richtigen Ort bin und dass alles, was geschieht, richtig ist - von da an konnte ich ruhig sein. Heute weiss ich: Das nennt man VERTRAUEN Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, konnte ich erkennen, dass emotionaler Schmerz und Leid nur Warnungen für mich sind, gegen meine eigene Wahrheit zu leben. Heute weiss ich: Das nennt man AUTHENTISCH SEIN. Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich aufgehört, mich nach einem anderen Leben zu sehnen und konnte sehen, dass alles um mich herum eine Aufforderung zum Wachsen war. Heute weiss ich, das nennt man REIFE. Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich aufgehört, mich meiner freien Zeit zu berauben, und ich habe aufgehört, weiter grandiose Projekte für die Zukunft zu entwerfen. Heute mache ich nur das, was mir Spass und Freude macht, was ich liebe und was mein Herz zum Lachen bringt, auf meine eigene Art und Weise und in meinem Tempo. Heute weiss ich, das nennt man EHRLICHKEIT. Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich mich von allem befreit, was nicht gesund für mich war, von Speisen, Menschen, Dingen, Situationen und von Allem, das mich immer wieder hinunterzog, weg von mir selbst. Anfangs nannte ich das ""Gesunden Egoismus"", aber heute weiss ich das ist SELBSTLIEBE. Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich aufgehört, immer recht haben zu wollen, so habe ich mich weniger geirrt. Heute habe ich erkannt, das nennt man DEMUT. Als ich mich selbst zu lieben begann, habe ich mich geweigert, weiter in der Vergangenheit zu leben und mich um meine Zukunft zu sorgen. Jetzt lebe ich nur noch in diesem Augenblick, wo ALLES stattfindet, so lebe ich heute jeden Tag und nenne es BEWUSSTHEIT. Als ich mich zu lieben begann, da erkannte ich, dass mich mein Denken armselig und krank machen kann. Als ich jedoch meine Herzenskräfte anforderte, bekam der Verstand einen wichtigen Partner. Diese Verbindung nenne ich heute HERZENSWEISHEIT. Wir brauchen uns nicht weiter vor Auseinandersetzungen, Konflikten und Problemen mit uns selbst und anderen zu fürchten, denn sogar Sterne knallen manchmal aufeinander und es entstehen neue Welten.

"If you feel-I did not say think-that you are worthless, you may be and probably are a victim of a culture that has told you that your worth depends on your achievements and the judgments of others. The feeling of worthlessness besets and enervates men and women, but in different ways. For women it can be a devastating experience, especially for those who experience depression after a loss of love or approval. The same society which supports organized brutality in the form of football and boxing, assigned them second-class citizen status-a promotion from the third-class status of only 30 years ago. They are vulnerable, they are moving targets. And men? David Burns, in his wonderful book, Feeling Good, wrote that men are even more vulnerable than women to feelings of worthlessness. He points out that men have been programmed since childhood to base their worth on their accomplishments. They must deal with unrealistic expectations assigned to them by the society in which they live. Winners are enshrined: all others are ""losers,"" and are forgotten. Our culture tells us that what we do is important. What we are is not. That's wrong, dead wrong. Consider this. If you base your worth on achievements such as production and advancement, you may dig yourself into a depressive pit when you fail (as we humans often do) to accomplish some objective or goal. Some modest and reasonable achievement in life is, of course, necessary. It's a matter of moderation and balance, working sensibly within the limits of your time, talents, and opportunities. My five foot, six inch neighbor will never play Center for the Boston Celtics. (But he's a grand teacher!) David Burns wrote, ""Consider the fact that most human beings are not great achievers, yet most people [survive, and] are happy and well respected."" If you base your worth on positive or negative criticisms from others, remember that these are merely judgments by people who don't have all the facts and who have no right to act as your self-appointed judges. If you determine your worth by such judgments, your life will be an up and down roller coaster ride that will make your life miserable. * Your best is good enough. So much for the common, distorted, twisted, damaging, hurtful, unrealistic, impossible and downright stupid definition of self-worth. * Albert Ellis has written extensively on this subject. He refers to ""The doctrine of variable worth."" Here's what worth is really all about. Worth is a philosophical idea, not a yardstick. Worth is based on self-judgment, not other-judgment. Worth is a constant, not a variable. Your worth is not contingent on your performance, degrees, trophies, possessions, titles, money, behavior,",or the judgment of anyone but you. And even you cannot judge it:,you,can only recognize it. Your worth is intrinsic to you as a human being distinguished from all other forms of life. Your behavior may be rational or irrational and your accomplishments modest,or,"enormous, but you are you, a human being with a mind and will. You are a million light years beyond your closest kin","in the animal world, and sixty-eleven-trillion zillion","light years (plus or minus six months) beyond any inanimate object in any galaxy or universe. You can neither increase nor diminish your worth. Among humans, you are not just special-you are unique. Please don't concern yourself about self-esteem and self-love. Those ideas involve rating, measuring (comparing to others), and judging.* Just accept yourself for what you are, a diamond in the rough. (But polish it once in a while.) Paul Hauck wrote a book on the subject of self-worth: Overcoming The Rating Game: Beyond Self-Love: Beyond Self-Esteem. Much recommended. So please don't tell me-or you-that you are worthless. If someone said to you the things you say to yourself, you would be insulted and probably say something like, ""You have no","Goddamned right to say that!"" Right, but then,","neither do you. Almost any therapist would tell you what I've just told you. So, spend $100 and check it out, or think it through and accept it. Sometimes I think people who feel worthless also think of themselves as perfectionists. Perfectionism borders on arrogance, and it's a nasty mind game which sets up the self as a sure loser. Someone recently said to me (he was bragging), ""I'm a perfectionist, you know."" I faked a sad and sympathetic frown and replied, ""Gee, I'm sorry to hear that,"" then added,","""Just","you and God, eh?"" My young friend was shocked. He frowned, took the point, and then experienced one of those","delightful ""Aha"" moments of enlightenment. It was a great moment","for him, and my privilege",to share in it. (Vince Fox)
"I accept myself because I'm alive and have the capacity to enjoy my existence. I am not my behavior. I can rate my traits and my behavior, but it is impossible to rate something as complex as my ""self."" My self consists of innumerable traits, not just this one. I strive for achievement only to enhance	the enjoyment of my existence, not to prove my worth. Failing at any task cannot make me a failure. I can choose to accept myself even if am unwilling or unable to change my ""character defects"" because there is no law of the universe that says I can't. My approval of myself cannot come from pandering to any external source or bowing to any external authority. My self-acceptance can only come from me, and I am free to choose it at any time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
